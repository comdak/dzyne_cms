	<h3>Web Apps</h3>
	<p>Web applications are growing more prevalent due to the fact that web is present everywhere. The ease and convenience of using a web browser as a client doubled with the ability to update and maintain web applications without distributing and installing software on hundreds of computers. At Dzyne Web Solutions, we can help you to develop your own web application so that business and everyday life can be easier for you. </p>
	<br />
	<p>Imagine accessibility with the click of a button. </p>
	<br />
	<p>The basic support for cross-platform compatibility has also increased. Common web applications such as webmail, online shopping and auctions are available to access on several different systems, and in turn have become increasingly more popular by the day.</p>
